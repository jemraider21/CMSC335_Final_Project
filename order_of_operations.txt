1.Basic GUI Framework:
    * Create the main window (stage) for your JavaFX application.
    * Set up the main layout, typically using a BorderPane or GridPane to position the different panels.

2.Time Panel:
    * Start with the Time Panel because it's one of the simpler components.
    * Display a static timestamp first.
    * Implement a mechanism to update this timestamp every second. You can use JavaFX's Timeline and KeyFrame for this before diving deep into threading.

3.Traffic Light Panel:
    * Design the visual representation of a traffic light: red, yellow, and green circles vertically aligned.
    * Initially, keep them static (e.g., all lights off or only one on).
    * Implement the logic to cycle through the lights in the specified order. Again, you can utilize Timeline for cycling before getting into threading.

4.Cars Panel:
    * Create a representation for cars. This could be simple rectangles or car icons.
    * Display them statically at their starting positions.
    * Develop the logic for movement based on speed and time. For the time being, you can hard code speeds or use dummy values.

5.Control Panel:
    * Add the buttons (Start, Pause, Stop, Continue) without functionality.
    * Implement functionality for the Start button first, triggering the movement of cars and cycling of traffic lights. The other buttons can be functional after multithreading is introduced.

6.Multithreading:
    * Begin with the time update functionality. Use Java's ScheduledExecutorService or a simple Thread to update the timestamp.
    * Move on to implement separate threads for traffic light cycling and car movement.
    * Ensure you handle synchronization properly, especially when checking traffic light statuses for car movements.

7.User Interactions:
    * Implement the Pause, Continue, and Stop button functionalities.
    * Add functionality to add more cars and intersections dynamically during runtime.

8.Constants & Assumptions Panel:
    * Incorporate the menu bar and design the documentation panel.
    * Add the unit settings toggle.

9.Testing & Debugging:
    * Begin with unit tests for smaller functionalities, like traffic light cycling or car movement logic.
    * Proceed with integration tests, where you'll test the interaction between car movement and traffic light statuses.
    * Ensure the GUI updates as expected, especially when multithreading is involved.

10.Documentation & Comments:
    * Ensure that all methods, classes, and significant logic sections have clear and concise comments.
    * Document any assumptions you've made during the implementation.

11.Refinements & Enhancements:
    *Once you have a working version, you can consider adding further enhancements, like allowing users to modify traffic light durations or introducing car acceleration/deceleration.

Starting with simpler components allows you to test the basic GUI framework and ensures that you have a solid foundation before diving into the more complex features. Always remember to test each component thoroughly before moving on to the next to ensure a smooth development process.
